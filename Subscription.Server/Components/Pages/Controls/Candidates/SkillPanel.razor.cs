/// <summary>
///     The SkillPanel class is a Blazor component that represents a panel for managing candidate skills in the
///     application.
///     It provides functionalities for deleting and editing skills, and it displays the skills in a grid.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The SkillPanel class includes properties for managing the skills of a candidate, such as DeleteSkill, EditRights,
///     EditSkill, GridSkill, IsRequisition, Model, ModelSkill, RowHeight, and SelectedRow.
///     These properties represent various aspects of the skill management process, including the event callbacks for
///     deleting and editing skills, the grid that displays the skills, the current user's rights to edit the skills, the
///     current context (whether it is a requisition or not), the model for the skills, the height of each row in the grid,
///     and the currently selected row in the grid.
///     The class also includes methods for deleting and editing skills, as well as handling the row selection event in the
///     grid.
