SET 1 - Submission Pipeline Metrics
Query 1 - Total Submissions
Counts all submissions created by the recruiter across different time periods (7D, MTD, QTD, HYTD, YTD). This provides a high-level view of the recruiter's activity volume. The query respects year boundaries by checking the earliest submission date.

Query 2 - Active Requisitions Worked
Counts unique requisitions with status NEW, OPN, or PAR that the recruiter has submitted candidates to. This shows how many active job openings the recruiter is currently working on. Helps track requisition coverage across time periods.

Query 3 - Interview Stage Candidates
Tracks candidates in INT (Interview) status where the recruiter made the initial submission. Uses the latest INT status date for time period categorization. Shows pipeline progression and interview scheduling effectiveness.

Query 4 - Offers Extended
Counts candidates who reached OEX (Offer Extended) status for requisitions where the recruiter was the first submitter. Indicates successful candidate progression through the hiring process. Uses latest OEX date for time period classification.

Query 5 - Successful Hires
Tracks candidates who achieved HIR (Hired) status where the recruiter initiated the submission. This is the key success metric showing actual placements. Demonstrates the recruiter's contribution to filling positions.

Query 6 - Offer-to-Hire Conversion Rate
Calculates the ratio of HIR to OEX statuses to show what percentage of extended offers result in successful hires. Helps identify potential issues in offer acceptance or negotiation. Returns 0 if no offers exist to prevent division errors.
