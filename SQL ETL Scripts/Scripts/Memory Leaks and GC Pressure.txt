 Memory Leaks and GC Pressure


   * `LoginModel` Instantiation: private LoginModel LoginModel { get; } = new();
       * The LoginModel is instantiated once when the Login component is created and is a property with only a getter, meaning it's read-only after initialization. This is good for memory
         management as it prevents re-instantiation.
       * LoginModel itself is a simple data holder, so it's unlikely to cause significant memory leaks unless it holds references to large, unmanaged resources, which is not apparent here.
   * `SfDialogService`, `ILocalStorageService`, `ISessionStorageService`, `NavigationManager`: These are injected services. Blazor's dependency injection handles their lifecycle, so they are
     generally not a source of memory leaks within the component itself.
   * `LoginToApplication` Method:
       * Dictionary<string, string> _parameters: This dictionary is created on each login attempt. For a small number of parameters, this is negligible.
       * string _response = await General.PostRest<string>("Login/LoginPage", _parameters);: The _response string holds the API response. If the response can be very large, it could
         temporarily increase memory usage, but strings are managed by the GC.
       * LocalStorage.SetItemAsync and SessionStorage.SetItemAsync: These store data in the browser's local/session storage. While they don't directly cause server-side memory leaks, storing
         excessively large data here could impact client-side performance. Given it's a login response, it's unlikely to be problematic.
   * `OnInitializedAsync` Method:
       * IEnumerable<Claim> _claims = await General.GetClaimsToken(LocalStorage, SessionStorage);: Similar to _response, the _claims enumerable is temporary.
       * The logic here is executed once when the component initializes.


  Overall: For a login page, the current implementation seems to have minimal impact on memory and GC pressure. There are no obvious signs of memory leaks. The objects created are
  generally short-lived and small.

  Code Refactoring Optimizations


   1. Magic Strings:
       * "Login/LoginPage": This API endpoint string is hardcoded. It would be better to define this as a constant or use a configuration setting, especially if the API base URL or endpoint
         names change.
       * "userName", "password", "PageState": These dictionary keys and storage keys are also magic strings.
   2. Error Handling in `LoginToApplication`:
       * if (_response.NullOrWhiteSpace()): This checks for an empty or whitespace response. It might be beneficial to have more specific error handling based on different API response codes
         (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 400 Bad Request) to provide more informative messages to the user.
       * DialogService.AlertAsync(null, "Invalid Credentials", General.DialogOptions("Invalid username or password."));: The null for the title in AlertAsync seems like a potential oversight
         or a default behavior. It might be clearer to explicitly pass a title.
   3. Redundant `base.OnInitializedAsync()` Call:
       * await base.OnInitializedAsync(); is called at the end of OnInitializedAsync. While not strictly an error, it's often recommended to call base.OnInitializedAsync() at the beginning of
         the override to ensure the base class's initialization logic runs first. However, in this specific case, it doesn't seem to cause any functional issues.
   4. Commented-out JWT Code:
       * The commented-out code for JwtSecurityTokenHandler and ClaimTypes suggests that JWT parsing was considered or used previously. If this functionality is no longer needed, it should be
         removed to keep the code clean. If it's planned for future use, it should be clearly documented or re-integrated.
   5. `General.PostRest` and `General.GetClaimsToken`:
       * These are static methods in a General class (presumably). While convenient, excessive use of static methods can sometimes make testing harder and reduce flexibility. Depending on the
         complexity of these methods, it might be worth considering making them injectable services if they have dependencies or manage state. However, for simple utility functions, static
         methods are fine.
   6. UI Element Styling:
       * style="text-transform: uppercase": This inline style for the username textbox could be moved to a CSS class for better separation of concerns and reusability.

  Other Optimizations/Suggestions


   1. Input Validation:
       * The EditForm is used, which implies validation. However, there's no explicit DataAnnotationsValidator or custom validation logic shown in Login.razor or Login.razor.cs for
         LoginModel properties (e.g., [Required] attributes). Adding client-side validation (even basic) can improve user experience by providing immediate feedback before an API call.
   2. Loading Indicator:
       * During the await General.PostRest call, the UI will be unresponsive. Adding a loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) can improve the user experience by showing that an operation is in
         progress.
   3. Password Handling:
       * Ensure that the password is sent securely (e.g., over HTTPS) and that the API handles it appropriately (e.g., hashing and salting). This is more of a security concern for the API,
         but worth mentioning.
   4. Navigation after Login:
       * NavigationManager.NavigateTo($"{NavigationManager.BaseUri}company");: This navigates to the "company" page. Consider if there are scenarios where the user should be redirected to a
         previously requested page (e.g., if they tried to access a protected resource before logging in).
   5. `General.DialogOptions`:
       * The General.DialogOptions method is used. It would be good to understand what options it sets. If it's always the same, it's fine, but if it varies, it might be worth exposing some
         parameters.

  Proposed Initial Refactoring Steps (for discussion)


   1. Introduce Constants for Magic Strings: Create a Constants class or similar to hold the API endpoint and storage keys.
   2. Add Basic Client-Side Validation: Add [Required] attributes to LoginModel properties and a DataAnnotationsValidator to the EditForm.
   3. Remove Commented-Out Code: Clean up the Login.razor.cs file by removing the commented-out JWT parsing logic.
   4. Move Inline Style to CSS: Create a CSS class for text-transform: uppercase and apply it to the username textbox.
